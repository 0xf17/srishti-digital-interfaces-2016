            <h2> 1. Spiced Rosemary Sea Salt Brownies</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
              <p1> 
                  1. Preheat the oven at 325F. Grease an 8inch brownie pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Dust 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder on the pan making sure to coat all sides.
                  <br>
                  2. Combine the coconut oil, sugar, maple syrup, cocoa powder, rosemary, cayenne, and salt in a bowl and fit it on top of a pot with simmering water (water shouldn’t touch the bowl). Let the steam warm the bowl (double boiler style) and stir until the coconut oil melts and the mix is smooth, make sure the sugar dissolves well. About 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and set aside.

                  3. While the cocoa mix is still warm (not hot! just warm to the touch), transfer to a larger bowl and add one egg at a time and whisk like a mad person until the batter is smooth and shiny. If it looks like it splitting just whisk some more and it should come together fine – alternatively you could place the bowl over some steam for a few seconds while whisking, this should bring it all together (just don’t heat the whole thing or you may end up with chocolate scrambled eggs). Once ready, add the flour in one go and stir until combined.
                  <br>
                  4. Place batter in prepared baking pan and bake for about 20 min, or until a toothpick comes out with moist batter. NOTE: you shouldn’t cook them ALL the way through or they’ll be super dry, a touch underdone is best. Let them cool, remove from pan, and cut in squares.
                  <br>
                  5. Drizzle squares with melted chocolate, and sprinkle with sea salt.

                1.Line an 8x8" square pan with parchment or foil and set aside.
                <br>
                2.Add hazelnuts to a food processor fitted with a metal "s" blade and pulse until a course meal forms.
                <br>
                3.Add the dates, cacao powder, 1 teaspoon water, and salt.  pulse a few times, stop the motor and use your fingers to pinch the mixture.  if the mixture is crumbly add more water 1 teaspoon at a time until you have a mixture that sticks together.
                <br>
                4.Press the mixture evenly into your prepared pan and freeze for 25 minutes.  using a sharp knife, slice into 8 bars.  drizzle with chocolate sauce and chopped hazelnuts (optional), and store in an airtight container in the fridge.  bars will stay good for up to 1 week.

             <h4> 3. Coffee Brownies With Homemade Nutella</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p3>
                1. Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 8 x 8 (or 9 x 9) pan with parchment paper.
                <br>
                2. Place the ground flax seeds in a small bowl and add the warm coffee. Mix well.
                <br>
                3. Place in the refrigerator and let sit for at least 5 minutes.
                <br>
                4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oat flour, almond and/or hazelnut meal, ground coffee, coconut sugar, baking soda and sea salt. Use your hands if needed to make sure that no clump remains.

                <br>
                5. In another bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil and vanilla extract. Add the flax and coffee mixture and mix well.
                <br>
                6. Pour the wet mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and mix to combine.
                <br>
                7. Pour batter into the parchment lined pan, smoothing the top evenly with a spoon or spatula. Add a few drops of the homemade Nutella on top of the batter and swirl with a knife to create a marble effect (as pictured above).
                <br>
                8. Bake for 20-23 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean (do not overcook - you want the middle to remain moist and slightly gooey). Let cool for about 10 minutes before slicing (the blondies will continue to firm up while cooling).
