            <br>
            <br>
             To swim in my mystic abode, getting submerged in the beauty of cyclic repetition. 
             As the wraped human body symbolises the cycle. Floral imagery subdues the elevated 
             discomfort caused by rediscovery of self. </P1>

                As I dream I go through
                multiple visuals and not so
                coherent experiences. The
                journey being a rush of
                exhilirance. Flowers for me
                bind the experiences that I
                have and the dreams that I
                draw.

                <P1>Jigsaw
                <br>
                <br>
                Floral forms morphing the
                beauty of possesion that I
                aspire to have. The artwork
                can be visually distributed on
                a grid with an unordered
                placement of matter. A game
                I play with myself of trying to
                fit the pieces of my Jigsaw.

            <br>
            <br>
                The coming of clouds to form
                puddles of reflection on the
                surface. A compilation of
                emotions such as satisfaction and relief.
