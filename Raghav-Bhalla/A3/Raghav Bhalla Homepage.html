           <h1>I would want to work with the Studio to evolve as an artist and learning by experience. I am an
aspiring artist and have an evolving practice of experimenting with different mediums and
materials. I do consider my understanding of contemporary visuals as my strength. I would love to
work with the studio to learn and evolve as an artist in the process. As I believe one of the major
lines Khoj works on is to provide an environment for artists to thrive.
