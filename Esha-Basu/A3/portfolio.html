<p> Shop of dreams was a project collaborated with Creative Producer and
Artistic Director: Symon Macintyre; where a group of dream catchers
set up a real shop, that sell dreams. Something people would never
expect to use currency to buy.
We never have any contorl over dreams. People have all sorts of dreams:
Whimsical, Fantastical, Scary, Realistic, etc. But how do we categorize
these dreams into materials that can be sold in a shop.
Can you at all buy dreams with money</p>
