            Nike calls them the Wing, and they’re noteworthy for what they’re missing. The Wing eschews hinges, temples, and earpieces all standard elements of sunglasses in favor of a single lens that wraps, Giordi-like, past the temples.

        <p> The unibody lens joins a silicone rubber strap that loops around the head. The result is a pair of shades that weighs just 26 grams and don’t so much sit on your head as hug it.

            Maybe the people using it used the same slang, but then again, maybe not. Spice, Scooby Snax, Black Mamba, Bliss. Not that it matters. Synthetic marijuana is a catch-all term for a huge variety of chemicals engineered to mimic weed. Problem is, these chemicals are way too good at their job. Another problem: The people using them usually have no idea what they’re actually smoking, so figuring out the right dose can be difficult and dangerous.

            For Snapchat, experimenting with filters is good for business. They prove the company’s value for advertisers as a creative way to let brands insert themselves in conversations that don’t alienate teens. The more filters people use, the more likely they’ll be to download a lens sponsored by a brand, like the Target branded filter that’s live right now. OK. So far so good. But this filter wasn’t about a brand. It serves no discernible purpose but it does normalize racial prejudice.
