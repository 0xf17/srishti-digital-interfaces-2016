      <strong>Hi!</strong>
      <p>I am Aadhira Narayan, a visual communication student at Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. My journey started all those years back, as I sketched out my first portrait. I loved the way something as simple as a pencil on paper, could open a whole new spectrum of unprecedented thought,and unfelt emotions. Artists harness this element of uncertainity to move the world. The power of the unknown is our stronghold and our elixir.  </p>
      <p>I have never been more aware of this than during my short stay in Srishti. My portfolio includes a series of works done mainly during the one year that I studied here.  </p>
