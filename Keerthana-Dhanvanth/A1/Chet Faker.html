<p>  
I'm not the reason<br> 
you're looking for redemption <br>      
You cut some strings <br>
And everything will fade away<br>
You tried to use some physical<br>
There's nothing left <br>
for you to say <br>
By the way <br>
    </p>
   
    
    <pre>
    
We used to be friends
We used to be inner circle
I don't' understand
What have I become to you
Take my good word
Turn it backwards
Turn your back on me
Is it a absurd
For me to hurt
When everything else is fading
    
    </pre>
    
    <pre>
Turn your back on me 
(used to be in a circle)
Is it a absurd
For me to hurt
When everything else is fading
