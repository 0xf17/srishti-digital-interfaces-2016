    <td>The giant panda bear is found at the top of the Yangtze Basin. Its range is confined to small remote mountain areas in the central China provinces of Sichuan, Gansus, and Shaanxi. Its population is declining since its original habitat has been reduced to a mere fraction due to deforestation, farming, global warming, poaching, hunting dogs, and other activities related to mankind.
    Panda bear features are unique. They are medium sized bears that have a more round figure than their cousins. In fact they are often portrayed as a roundish dog in early information sketches. They have white with black ears and teardrop circles around their eyes. Their arms and legs are black along with a band extending from their front arms around their back. Their tail is short and white.

      <td>Giant pandas live in large bamboo forests on humid and relatively high mountains — about 1,200 to 3,100 meters (4,000 to 10,000 feet) above sea level. Currently about 1,600 giant pandas live in over 20,000 square kilometers (8,000 mi2) of habitat.
    These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst they will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.      
    These guys are BIG eaters - every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!  
    The giant panda's scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means 'black and white cat-foot'.  
    Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.  
 Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm - that's about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.

        The life span of giant pandas in the wild is approximately 20 years. Captive pandas may live to be 25-30 years old.
      The eyespots of a giant panda cub are initially in the shape of a circle. As the cub grows, the circles become shaped like a teardrop.
        Pandas have been a symbol of peace in China. For example, hundreds of years ago, warring tribes in China would raise a flag with a picture of a panda on it to stop a battle or call a truce.
        Pandas are pigeon-toed; in other words, they walk with their front paws turned inward
