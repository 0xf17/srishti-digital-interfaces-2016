    Jakkur Lake </p>

    <p> Even though the lake has been fenced by the Bangalore Development Authorities (BDA) and there are 12 home guards running on shifts to regulate the correct disposal of waste within the premises of the lake, there are other ways in which the lake is being encroached upon. There are apartment buildings that have been constructed at about 50m-75m from the main lake. Even though this may not be directly within the boundaries of the lake or violating any regulations, the proximity of these concrete monsters to the lake is harmful enough to swallow up the purity of the lake. Humans tend to use and abuse all of nature’s resources, with or without intending to. Human settlements so close to the lake, means the number of vehicles going in and around the apartments would naturally be high, infusing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and finally into the lake. This is ironic because people pay higher amounts to live in those flats that have a great view of the lake, while diminishing it’s purity. The irony is further pushed to the point of realizing that we eventually consume this water, at the end of the cycle. I would like to study this cyclic relationship and deduce the idea of <b>indirect encroachment </b>in the form of a pattern. </p>

    <p>On an average, the local village folk are able to get about 20 to 30kgs of fish everyday. In the peak season, up to 500kgs of fish can be collected. A lot of fisherman cast their nets overnight and come to get their catch at dawn – but what happens during the course of the night is birds swoop down in search of fish and get trapped in the net and eventually down and die. Humans tend to create <b>collateral damage</b>, again – with or without intending to. We get caught up with our immediate wants and needs that we don’t realize the damage it causes to the ecosystem. This again is ironic because it is us humans who take pride in the fact that this lake is home to so many species of birds. This is my second observation that I would like to depict as a constant loose-ended pattern.

    <p>The third observation is the relationship of the flora – the weeds in particular, with the water and it’s aquatic life. Many aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth act as a secondary filter in purifying the water, while at the same time diminish the oxygen supply by obstructing sunlight. I would like to study the <b>interdependency</b> between the water and the weeds and illustrate this visually. </p>
